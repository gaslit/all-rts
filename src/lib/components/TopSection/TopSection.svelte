Real time strategy once defined a generation of desktop gamers: we're diehard fans who've never forgotten. Our dream is to bring that spirit back for everyone, everywhere-- with fast, 10 minute matches that can be played on mobile or web.

<br><br>

All RTS is our passion projectâ€”a completely free, fan-made tribute to the classics we grew up with. It has all the gameplay we love: base-building, resource-gathering and epic battles; redesigned for touch controls and connected with modern multiplayer matchmaking-- no in-app purchases, no ads and no pay to win.

<br><br>
We built this for ourselves, our friends and for you: to relive the magic of those days and to share that same excitement with a new generation of players. Will you join us on the battlefield?
