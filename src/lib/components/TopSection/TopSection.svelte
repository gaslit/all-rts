We're a small team of diehard fans who have never forgotten how RTS games once defined a generation of gamers. Our mission is to bring back the genre, and make it accessible to everyone-- with fast, ten minute matches for mobile phones and browsers.

AllRTS is our passion projectâ€”a completely free, fan-made tribute to the classics we grew up with. It has all the gameplay we love: base-building, resource-gathering and epic battles; redesigned for touch controls and connected with modern multiplayer matchmaking-- no in-app purchases, no ads and no pay to win. We built this for ourselves, our friends and for you: to relive the magic of those days and to share that same excitement with a new generation of players.

Will you join us on the battlefield?
